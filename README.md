# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Dataset

Jupyter notebooks from this project are run on Python 3.6.3

### Description
This is my mini project working with data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).  This data set contains features computed from digitized images of cells extracted by a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass from 569 patients.  The biopsies from these patients were histologically classified into malignant and benign [(Wolberg et al, 1994)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030438359490099X?via%3Dihub).  The goal of working with this dataset is to build a learning algorithm based on these data to accurately classify cells into malignant and benign classes.  

The analysis is separated into two notebooks: 

1) **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset - Exploration** 
    * This notebook contains visualizations and plots I made of the data to explore and get a handle on different features and their distribution. 
2) **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset - Classification**
    * This notebook contains different classifiers that I attempted, and model parameters I attempted to tune to optimize the model.
